# OIBSIP-Task1 #IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Taken the dataset from the task  The Iris dataset contains columns for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species label.
This project explores the famous Iris dataset, diving into data exploration, label encoding, and insightful visualizations using Seaborn. The repository guides you through scatter plots and violin plots, shedding light on the relationships between Sepal and Petal measurements across different species. Moving forward, we delve into model building and testing, employing a Decision Tree Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier for species prediction.
